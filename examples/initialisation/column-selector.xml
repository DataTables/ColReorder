<info><![CDATA[

This example shows the use of `-init colReorder.columns` to select which columns should be orderable. Please note that if a column is not orderable, then it also cannot have its position replaced by another column. This is particularly useful at the start or the end of a table where you might wish to have important information fixed in place.

In this example the first and last columns are locked in place. Depending on your application, you will need to alter this selector. Note that you can use any `-type column-selector`, including an array of column indexes to pick the columns you want to have as moveable.
