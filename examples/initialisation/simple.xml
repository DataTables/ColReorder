<info><![CDATA[

This example shows the basic use case of the ColReorder plug-in. With ColReorder enabled for a table, the user has the ability to click and drag any table header cell, and drop it where they wish the column to be inserted. The insert point is shown visually, and the column reordering is done as soon as the mouse button is released.

ColReorder is added to a DataTable through the `cr-init colReorder` initialisation option which can be set to `true` to use the default options for ColReorder (as shown in this example) or used as an object to set options, as shown in other examples.
